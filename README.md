# Daily-Work-Scheduler

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## Description

The main goal of this project is to Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It will also have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on declaring/calling variables, functions, arrow-functions, if-statments, callbacks and for loops. I also learned some better ways to refactor the JavaScript code, thus making the code easier to read and more modular!
